<!-- I am currently pursuing a Master degree in Computer Science at Duke University. However, I have only seen the campus **TWICE**. F*** [Corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)!
 -->
I'm a fully vaccinated personnel right now. Had my first/last shot of Janssen on April 2nd. You're safe to continue browing without a mask.

I have a Bachalor Degree in Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech, because my _retarded brain_ couldn't decide between CS and EE.

I like the **[Stonk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/wallstreetbets)**! {{< icon "rocket icon-pulse-fast" >}} BuuuuuuT Do NOT hold GME like I did :(
